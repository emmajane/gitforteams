## Past Presentations

The content in this repository is based on Emma's work as a
version control advocate, and instructor. She has been working
on the concepts outlined here since her days as an instructor at
Humber College (where she taught liberal arts
students how to use CVS).

Emma first made the switch to teaching version control with
adult education best practices in mind at DrupalCamp Toronto in
2012. Variations of this presentation have been delivered at 
php[tek] (2013), DrupalCamp TwinCities (2013), DrupalCon Prague 
(2013), LoneStar PHP (2014), among other places.
